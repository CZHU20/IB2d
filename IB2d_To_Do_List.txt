%
% LAGRANGIAN STRUCTURE 
%
1. Finish force calculation for 3-Element Hill Model
2. Fix Lagrangian Pts. passing through boundaries (for periodic domains)
3. Add non-invariant beams (now just have torsional springs)
4. Allow for one than one boundary to be read in

%
% FLUID SOLVER / BLACK-BOX
% 
1. Optimize muscle model force computations
2. Stoke's Fluid Solver
3. Non-Newtonian Fluid Solver
4. Parallelization
5. Port electrophysiology code to Python (thank you Christopher Strickland for all else!)
6. Port code to Julia

% EXAMPLES
%
1. Fix Jellyfish FORWARD swimming examples
        -update_beam() curavture example
        -springs and beams forward swimming example
        -springs only forward swimming example
2. Fix muscle model parameters for both types
        -Length-Tension/Force-Velocity model
        -3-Element Hill Model / LT-FV model
